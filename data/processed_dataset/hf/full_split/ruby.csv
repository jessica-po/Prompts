I am trying to create a function that will take a list of numbers as an argument and return the sum of the numbers. However, I want the function to ignore any number that is less than 5. Here is my current code:

def sum_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num >= 5:
            total += num

When I run this code with the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], it should return 11 (since 5 is less than 5, it should be ignored). But instead, it returns 16. What am I doing wrong?

 logical thinking: 

The problem lies in the conditional statement. The condition should be `if num > 5` instead of `if num >= 5`. This way, the function will only add numbers greater than or equal to 5 to the total.
